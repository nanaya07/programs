Greedy algorithm: use heuristic to choose locally optimal choices intent to find global optimum. Not always optimum: reasonable steps.
	Five components
1. A candidate set, from which a solution is created
2. A selection function, which chooses the best candidate to be added to the solution
3. A feasibility function, that is used to determine if a candidate can be used to contribute to a solution
4. An objective function, which assigns a value to a solution, or a partial solution, and
5. A solution function, which will indicate when we have discovered a complete solution
